# Drought-Prediction

This project predicts drought for counties in the US based on PSDI and SPI data. Credits for data can be found in the notebook. Once the notebook is opened, it can be run from top to bottom to train the model and predict results

More information about the project can be found in the paper or poster in this repository.
